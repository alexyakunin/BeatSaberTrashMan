The Trash Man
=====
Allows you to reduce and potentially eliminate stuttering by tuning the garbage collector.

By default this plugin only enables LowLatency mode in GameCore however most people will want to enable `Disable GC during gameplay` under `Mod Settings`. This option reduces stuttering the most but could cause issues on low memory machines however it doesn't hurt to give it a try if you're experiencing a lot of stuttering problems.

Want to learn about the different GC modes? Refer to [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/latency)
